# SQL practice code

## Background
With increasing use of several relational database management systems in all organisations, I decided to gain better understanding of the ETL process that precedes all types of analytical processes in a data science project. Thus, in this repository I have documented my journey to learning SQL querying. It consists of SQL practice scripts and database files (wherever applicable)
     
## References
Firstly, I plan to work through the popular O'Reilly SQL reference book - “Learning SQL, Third Edition, by Alan Beaulieu. Copyright 2020 Alan Beaulieu”. The script files are uploaded in different chapter-wise folders for ease of reference. After gaining some familiarity with the syntax, I will start working through practice examples on online learning portals like HackerRank

## HackerRank Progress
Earned 3rd star and reached the silver level after practicing easy level queries on - basic select, advanced select and joins. </br>

## Closing comments
Please feel free to provide your inputs on any of the scripts as you deem might be helpful in my learning journey. Thanks for reading!
