# SQL practice code

## Background
With increasing use of several relational database management systems in all organisations, I decided to gain better understanding of the ETL process that precedes all types of analytical processes in a data science project. Thus, in this repository I have documented my journey to learning SQL querying. It consists of SQL practice scripts and database files (wherever applicable)
     
## References 
Firstly, I plan to work through the popular O'Reilly book - “Learning SQL, Third Edition, by Alan Beaulieu. Copyright 2020 Alan Beaulieu”. The script files are uploaded in different chapter-wise folders for ease of reference

## Built with 
MySQL workbench 8.0.19 

## Closing comments
Please feel free to provide your inputs on any of the scripts as you deem might be helpful in my learning journey. Thanks for reading!
